<dt>What is AR?</dt>
    <dd>Augmented Reality is when you superimpose digitally-designed objects onto the real world using a viewing window. Basically, you see computer-generated graphics like a cloud or an arrow in <b>your environment</b> as seen through a smartphone camera or even a specialised headset designed for the purpose.</dd>

<dt>Okay, but what's the difference between this and VR?</dt>
    <dd>AR displays digital object <b>on top of</b> your real world - such as a unicorn standing in your bedroom or huge robotic spiders crawling on your wall. VR, on the other hand, <b>replaces</b> your real world with the digital one that you see through a VR headset such as Oculus Rift or Google Cardboard.</dd>

<dt>How does the TravelAR app use AR?</dt>
    <dd>The app superimposes arrows and pointers onto the airport scene to provide with simple directions and also translates the airport's information boards to the user's preferred language and displays them as if that were the original text.</dd>
