For the initial prototype of the app, we have used  the ever-popular Android Studio. Android studio provides, to quote them: <cite>World-class code editing, debugging, performance tooling, a flexible build system, and an instant build/deploy system all allow you to focus on building unique and high quality apps.</cite> You can explore more details on their <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/features.html" title="Go to Android Studio's features page">website</a>.

We are deploying Indoor Navigation technology in our application. The library we have used is a Cross-Platform, Open-Source one, called AnyPlace. This is a sevice for indoor navigation that offers localization without the use of GPS, using smartphones instead.
